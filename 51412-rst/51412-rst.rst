   INTRODUCTION

.. vspace:: 2

Whence arose the popular belief that some
persons impart luck to the books of other
persons? The answer, if it were not a question of
books but of other projectiles, would be (in savage
society) that one man has more *maya* or *wakan* or
*orenda* than another; has more of a subtle, imponderable,
potent, innermost, all-pervading something
than another, and that he can communicate this
gift, by luck or otherwise, to others.  Thus in
Rutuya a medicine man communicated his *maya* to
Colonel Gudgeon, to Lieutenant Grant, and other
gentlemen, who then walked barefoot but unsinged
over a floor of red-hot stones.  Obviously our
civilized faith in prefaces by other hands than the
author's (usually the better man), is part of the
*orenda* or *maya* superstition or belief.

Were I conscious of possessing *maya* or luck, I
would gladly impart it to all men, if all men were
equally virtuous, like the teacher of the art of flying
in "Rasselas," by Dr. Samuel Johnson.  But I am
so far from being conscious of possessing *maya*
that I only wish, if there be indeed a quantity of
this transcendental ether, that some one who had
plenty of it would write introductions for my books,
which stand greatly in need of a supernormal "send
off."  Still they are not in quite such evil case as
they would be were I a poet, for many a man and
most women most justly disesteem their own
capacity for reading verses.  Indeed that art is now
almost lost, and it is strange to think that there
are probably to-day more persons who write verse
than who read it.  Poetry, like Christmas cards, is
bought, not to keep, but to give away at Christmas,
on birthdays, and, by economical friends of the
bride, at weddings.  There is always plenty of
poetry in small volumes, in flabby leather covers,
among the array of wedding presents.  This
offering is a survival: the idea of love is still
connected with the writings of Tennyson and Browning,
though experience tells us that the poetry-reading
days of the pair end at the altar.

The child of an earlier generation, I was capable
of reading verses in my youth, and even now can
do so, retaining at least that faculty of a dead
world, just as the last Pict held the secret of
"brewing the ale from the heather bell."  Mr. Charles
Murray's ale (which is excellent) is all
brewed from the heather bell, is pure Scots; and
he sings the songs of our national Zion on "a
distant and a deadly shore," that of the Transvaal—though
this is a mere figure of speech, the Transvaal,
like Bohemia, possessing at present no sea-coast.

To the patriotic Scot there is somewhat affecting
in the echoes of very rich Scots which reach us
across the African continent and "seas that row
between."  To speak for myself, I am never so
happy as when I cross the Tweed at Berwick from
the South, or go on the links at Wimbledon
Common, and hear the accents (for there are several,
including that peculiar to Gourock) of my native
tongue.  These observes are quite genuine, and
come from a Scot whose critics in England banter
him on his patriotism, while his critics in Scotland
revile him as rather more unpatriotic than the
infamous Sir John Menteith, who whummled the
bannock.  The Scots of Mr. Murray is so pure and
so rich that it may puzzle some patriots whose
sentiments are stronger than their linguistic
acquirements.  The imitations of Horace are among the
best extant, and Mr. Murray might take Professor
Blackie's advice, trying how far the most rustic
idylls of Theocritus, say the "Oaristus," can be
converted into the Doric of the Lowlands.  If one
may have favourites, among these is "The Packman,"
"The Howe of Alford," "The Hint o' Hairst,"
"The Antiquary," and "The Lettergae."  Does any
Lettergae survive in this age of guilt when the
harmonium pervades the kirks which our fathers
purified from the Romish organ? Indeed, the poems
beget a certain melancholy.  "I am never merry when
I hear sweet music" from a world that is dead or
dying, the world of Scott and Hogg, the world that
knew not polluted streams, and railways, and motor
cars, and, worst of abominations, the gramophone.

In a far-off land Mr. Murray retains the sentiment
of that forgotten time, and is haunted by the scent
of peat and bog myrtle, the sound of old words
that now are strange, the poverty that was not
the mate of discontent.  *Enfin* he has the secret of
the last of the Picts, if indeed *he* was the last, if
they do not dwell with "The Secret Commonwealth
of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies" in the secret places
of the hills.  Poetry more truly Scots than that of
Mr.  Murray is no longer written—was not written
even by Mr. Stevenson, about "a' the bonny U. P. Kirks,"
for in his verses there was a faint twinkle
of the spirit of mockery.

   |  Hot youth ever is a ranger,
   |    New scenes ever its desire;
   |  Cauld Eild, doubtfu' o' the stranger,
   |    Thinks but o' haudin' in the fire.

   |  Midway, the wanderer is weary,
   |    Fain he'd be turnin' in his prime

   |  In Afric's fabled fountains I have panned the golden sand—
   |    Caught crocodile with baviaan for bait—
   |  I've fished, with blasting gelatine for hook an' gaff an' wand,
   |    An' lured the bearded barbel to his fate:
   |  But take your Southern rivers that meander to the sea,
   |  And set me where the Leochel joins the Don,
   |  With eighteen feet of greenheart an' the tackle running free—
   |          *I want to have a clean fish on.*

   |  The eland an' the tsessebe I've tracked from early dawn,
   |    I've heard the roar of lions shake the night,
   |  I've fed the lonely bush-veld camp on dik-kop an' korhaan,
   |    An' watched the soaring vulture in his flight;
   |  For horn an' head I've hunted, yet the spoil of gun and spear,
   |    My trophies, I would freely give them all,
   |  To creep through mist an' heather on the great red deer—
   |          *I want to hear the black cock call.*

   |  In hot December weather when the grass is caddie high
   |    I've driven clean an' lost the ball an' game,
   |  When winter veld is burned an' bare I've cursed the cuppy lie—
   |    The language is the one thing still the same;
   |  For dongas, rocks, an' scuffled greens give me the links up North,
   |    The whins, the broom, the thunder of the surf,
   |  The three old fellows waiting where I used to make a fourth—
   |          *I want to play a round on turf.*

   |  I've faced the fremt, its strain an' toil, in market an' in mine,
   |    Seen Fortune ebb an' flow between the "Chains,"
   |  Sat late o'er starlit banquets where the danger spiced the wine,
   |    But bitter are the lees the alien drains;
   |  For all the time the heather blooms on distant Benachie,
   |    An' wrapt in peace the sheltered valley lies,
   |  I want to wade through bracken in a glen across the sea—
   |          *I want to see the peat reek rise.*

   |  He cut a sappy sucker from the muckle rodden-tree,
   |  He trimmed it, an' he wet it, an' he thumped it on his knee;
   |  He never heard the teuchat when the harrow broke her eggs,
   |  He missed the craggit heron nabbin' puddocks in the seggs,
   |  He forgot to hound the collie at the cattle when they strayed,
   |  But you should hae seen the whistle that the wee herd made!

   |  He wheepled on't at mornin' an' he tweetled on't at nicht,
   |  He puffed his freckled cheeks until his nose sank oot o' sicht,
   |  The kye were late for milkin' when he piped them up the closs,
   |  The kitlins got his supper syne, an' he was beddit boss;
   |  But he cared na doit nor docken what they did or thocht or said,
   |  There was comfort in the whistle that the wee herd made.

   |  For lyin' lang o' mornin's he had clawed the caup for weeks,
   |  But noo he had his bonnet on afore the lave had breeks;
   |  He was whistlin' to the porridge that were hott'rin' on the fire,
   |  He was whistlin' ower the travise to the baillie in the byre;
   |  Nae a blackbird nor a mavis, that hae pipin' for their trade,
   |  Was a marrow for the whistle that the wee herd made.

   |  He played a march to battle, it cam' dirlin' through the mist,
   |  Till the halflin' squared his shou'ders an' made up his mind to 'list;
   |  He tried a spring for wooers, though he wistna what it meant,
   |  But the kitchen-lass was lauchin' an' he thocht she maybe kent;
   |  He got ream an' buttered bannocks for the lovin' lilt he played.
   |  Wasna that a cheery whistle that the wee herd made?

   |  He blew them rants sae lively, schottisches, reels, an' jigs,
   |  The foalie flang his muckle legs an' capered ower the rigs,
   |  The grey-tailed futt'rat bobbit oot to hear his ain strathspey,
   |  The bawd cam' loupin' through the corn to "Clean Pease Strae";
   |  The feet o' ilka man an' beast gat youkie when he played—
   |  Hae ye ever heard o' whistle like the wee herd made?

   |  But the snaw it stopped the herdin' an' the winter brocht him dool,
   |  When in spite o' hacks an' chilblains he was shod again for school;
   |  He couldna sough the catechis nor pipe the rule o' three,
   |  He was keepit in an' lickit when the ither loons got free;
   |  But he aften played the truant—'twas the only thing he played,
   |  For the maister brunt the whistle that the wee herd made!

   |  A stane-cast fae the clachan heid
   |  An auld feal dyke enclosed a reed
   |  O' garden grun', where flower an' weed
   |          In spring grew first aye;
   |  An' there the humble hauddin' steed
   |          O' Skeely Kirsty.

   |  Upon the easin' sods a fou
   |  Thick-leaved an' sappy yearly grew,
   |  Which, for a scrat or scabbit mou',
   |          Beat aught in "Buchan";
   |  An' draughts fae herbs she used to brew
   |          That drank like brochan.

   |  To heal a heid, or scob a bane,
   |  To ease a neebour's grippit wean,
   |  Or thoom a thraw, there wasna ane
   |          Could e'er come near her;
   |  Nae income, fivver, hoast, nor nane
   |          Would ever steer her.

   |  She cured for pleasure, nae for fees;
   |  Healed man an' beast wi' equal ease:

   |          To Spence the carrier,
   |  That cured his mear, when the disease

   |  Was there a corp to streck or kist,
   |  She aye was foremost to assist;

   |  Syne handed roon' anither taste
   |          Afore they lifted.

   |  It's but a fortnight since we laid him doon,
   |    An' cut the sods to hap his narrow lair—
   |  On Sunday still the grass was dry an' broon;
   |    An' noo they're up again the kist is bare,
   |  For Bell this day we e'en maun lay aboon,
   |    An' face in fun'ral blacks the drift ance mair.

   |  Twa Fiersdays back she seem'd baith swak an' strang,
   |    A' day her clogs were clankin' roon' the closs;
   |  An' tho' an income she'd complained o' lang
   |    It never kept her yet fae kirk or moss.
   |  Wha would hae thocht she'd be the next to gang
   |    That never grieved a grain at Jeames's loss?

   |  It seem'd richt unco—faith, 'twas hardly fair,
   |    Just when he thocht to slip awa' at last
   |  An' drap for aye the trams o' wardly care—

   |  Ere she was pechin' up the gowden stair,

   |    An' bonnets clad the green,
   |  Aye in the thickest o' the strife
   |    Auld Dusty Tam was seen.
   |  Nae Tarlan' man daur flout his fame
   |    Had he a chance to hear;

   |    When he cam' aff his mear.

   |    He kept it—till St. Sairs.

   |  The neighbours clash lood o' my drinkin',
   |    An' naething hits harder than truth;
   |  But tales micht be tempered, I'm thinkin',
   |    Gin fouk would consider my drooth.
   |  Nae doot, at the Widow's displenish
   |    Gey aften I emptied the stoup;
   |  But thrift is a thing we should cherish,
   |    An' whisky's aye free at a roup.
   |  Week in an' week oot, when I'm millin',
   |    The sids seem to stick in my throat;
   |  Nae wonder at markets I'm willin'
   |    To spend wi' a crony a groat.
   |  An' if I've a shaltie to niffer,
   |    Or't maybe some barley to sell,
   |  An oonslockened bargain's aye stiffer—
   |    Ye ken that fu' brawly yersel'.
   |  Fae forbears my thirst I inherit,
   |    As others get red hair or gout;
   |  The heirship's expensive: mair merit
   |    To me that I never cry out.
   |  An' sae, man, I canna help thinkin'
   |    The neighbours unkindly; in truth,
   |  Afore they can judge o' my drinkin'
   |    They first maun consider my drooth.

   |  There was a couthy Packman, I kent him weel aneuch,
   |  The simmer he was quartered within the Howe o' Tough;
   |  He sleepit in the barn end amo' the barley strae
   |  But lang afore the milkers he was up at skreek o' day,
   |  An' furth upon the cheese stane set his reekin' brose to queel
   |  While in the caller strype he gied his barkit face a sweel;
   |  Syne wi' the ell-wan' in his neive to haud the tykes awa'
   |  He humpit roon' the country side to clachan, craft an' ha'.

   |  Upon the flaggit kitchen fleer he dumpit doon his pack,
   |  Fu' keen to turn the penny ower, but itchin' aye to crack;
   |  The ploomen gaithered fae the fur', the millert fae the mill,
   |  The herd just gied his kye a turn an' skirtit doon the hill,
   |  The smith cam' sweatin' fae the fire, the weaver left his leem,
   |  The lass forgot her comin' kirn an' connached a' the ream,
   |  The cauper left his turnin' lay, the sooter wasna slaw
   |  To fling his lapstane in the neuk, the elshin, birse an' a'.

   |  The Packman spread his ferlies oot, an' ilka maid an' man
   |  Cam' soon on something sairly nott, but never missed till than;
   |  He'd specs for peer auld granny when her sicht begood to fail,
   |  An' thummles, needles, preens an' tape for whip-the-cat to wale,
   |  He'd chanter reeds an' fiddle strings, an' trumps wi' double stang,
   |  A dream beuk 'at the weeda wife had hankered after lang,
   |  He'd worsit for the samplers, an' the bonniest valentines,
   |  An' brooches were in great request wi' a' kirk-gangin' queyns.

   |  He'd sheafs o' rare auld ballants, an' an antrin swatch he sang
   |  Fae "Mill o' Tiftie's Annie," or o' "Johnnie More the Lang,"
   |  He would lilt you "Hielan' Hairry" till the tears ran doon his nose,
   |  Syne dicht them wi' a doonward sleeve an' into "James the Rose";
   |  The birn that rowed his shou'ders tho' sae panged wi' things to sell
   |  Held little to the claik he kent, an' wasna laith to tell,—
   |  A waucht o' ale to slock his drooth, a pinch to clear his head,
   |  An' the news cam' fae the Packman like the water doon the lade.

   |  He kent wha got the bledder when the sooter killed his soo,
   |  An' wha it was 'at threw the stane 'at crippled Geordie's coo,
   |  He kent afore the term cam' roon' what flittin's we would see,
   |  An' wha'd be cried on Sunday neist, an' wha would like to be,
   |  He kent wha kissed the sweetie wife the nicht o' Dancie's ball,
   |  An' what ill-trickit nickum catched the troot in Betty's wall,
   |  He was at the feein' market, an' he kent a' wha were fou,
   |  An' he never spoiled a story by consid'rin' gin 'twas true.

   |  Nae plisky ever yet was played but he could place the blame,
   |  An' tell you a' the story o't, wi' chapter, verse an' name,
   |  He'd redd you up your kith an' kin atween the Dee an' Don,
   |  Your forbears wha were hanged or jiled fae auld Culloden on,
   |  Altho he saw your face get red he wouldna haud his tongue,
   |  An' only leuch when threatened wi' a reemish fae a rung;
   |  But a' the time the trade gaed on, an' notes were rankit oot
   |  Had lang been hod in lockit kists aneth the Sunday suit.

   |  An' faith the ablach threeve upon't, he never cried a halt
   |  Until he bocht fae Shou'der-win' a hardy cleekit shalt,
   |  An' syne a spring-cairt at the roup when cadger Willie broke,
   |  That held aneth the cannas a' that he could sell or troke;
   |  He bocht your eggs an' butter, an' awat he wasna sweer
   |  To lift the poacher's birds an' bawds when keepers werna near;
   |  Twa sizzens wi' the cairt an' then—his boolie rowed sae fine—
   |  He took a roadside shoppie an' put "Merchant" on the sign.

   |  An' still he threeve an' better threeve, sae fast his trade it grew
   |  That he thirled a cripple tailor an' took in a queyn to shue,
   |  An' when he got a stoot guidwife he didna get her bare,
   |  She brocht him siller o' her ain 'at made his puckle mair,
   |  An' he lent it oot sae wisely—deil kens at what per cent—
   |  That farmers fan' the int'rest near as ill to pay's the rent;
   |  An' when the bank set up a branch, the wily boddies saw
   |  They beet to mak' him Agent to hae ony chance ava'

   |  Tho' noo he wore a grauvit an' a dicky thro' the week
   |  There never was a bargain gaun 'at he was far to seek,
   |  He bocht the crafter's stirks an' caur, an' when the girse was set
   |  He aye took on a park or twa, an' never rued it yet;
   |  Till when a handy tack ran oot his offer was the best
   |  An' he dreeve his gig to kirk an' fair as canty as the rest,
   |  An' when they made him Elder, wi' the ladle it was gran'
   |  To see him work the waster laft an' never miss a man.

   |  He sent his sons to college, an' the auldest o' the three—
   |  Tho' wi' a tyauve—got Greek aneuch to warsle thro's degree,
   |  An' noo aneth the soundin' box he wags a godly pow;
   |  The second loon took up the law, an' better fit there's fyou
   |  At chargin' sax an' auchtpence, or at keepin' on a plea,
   |  An' stirrin' strife 'mang decent fouk wha left alane would 'gree;
   |  The youngest ane 's a doctor wi' a practice in the sooth,
   |  A clever couthy cowshus chiel some hampered wi' a drooth.

   |  The dother—he had only ane—gaed hine awa' to France
   |  To learn to sing an' thoom the harp, to parley-voo an' dance;
   |  It cost a protty penny but 'twas siller wisely wared
   |  For the lass made oot to marry on a strappin' Deeside laird;
   |  She wasna just a beauty, but he didna swither lang,
   |  For he had to get her tocher or his timmer had to gang:
   |  Sae noo she sits "My Lady" an' nae langer than the streen
   |  I saw her wi' her carriage comin' postin' ower Culblean.

   |  But tho' his bairns are sattled noo, he still can cast the coat
   |  An' work as hard as ever to mak' saxpence o' a groat;
   |  He plans as keen for years to come as when he first began,
   |  Forgettin' he's on borrowed days an' past the Bible span.
   |  See, yon's his hoose, an' there he sits; supposin' cry in,
   |  It's cheaper drinkin' toddy there than payin' at the Inn,
   |  You'll find we'll hae a shortsome nicht an' baith be bidden back,
   |  But—in your lug—ye maunna say a word aboot the Pack.

   |  I'm weary, weary houkin', in the cauld, weet, clorty clay,
   |    But this will be the deepest in the yaird;
   |  It's nae a four fit dibble for a common man the day—
   |    Ilk bane I'm layin' by is o' a laird.
   |  Whaever slips the timmers, lippens me to mak' his bed,
   |    For lairds maun just be happit like the lave;
   |  An' kistit corps are lucky, for when a'thing's deen an' said,
   |    There's lythe, save for the livin', in a grave.

   |  Up on the watch-tower riggin' there's a draggled hoodie craw
   |    That hasna missed a funeral the year;
   |  He kens as weel's anither this will fairly ding them a',
   |    Nae tenant on the land but will be here.
   |  Sae up an' doon the tablin' wi' a gloatin' roupy hoast,

   |  As if some deil rejoicin' that anither sowl was lost
   |    An' waitin' for his share o' the dregie.

   |  There's sorrow in the mansion, an' the Lady that tak's on
   |    Is young to hae sae muckle on her ban',
   |  Wi' the haugh lands to excamb where the marches cross the Don,
   |    An' factors aye hame-drauchted when they can.
   |  Come spring, we'll a' be readin', when the kirk is latten oot,
   |    "Displenish" tackit up upon the yett;
   |  For hame-fairm, cairts an' cattle, will be roupit up, I doot,

   |    An' tho' they spak' o' him as bein' auld,
   |  It seerly seemed unlikely I would see him in the yird,
   |    For lang ere he was beardit I was bald.
   |  It's three year by the saxty, come the week o' Hallow Fair,
   |    Since first I laid a divot on a grave;

   |    An' coont the sheaves I've stookit, by the thrave.

   |  I hae kent grief at Marti'mas would neither haud nor bin'—
   |    It was sair for even unco folk to see;
   |  Yet ere the muir was yellow wi' the blossom on the whin,
   |    The tears were dry, the headstane a' ajee.
   |  Nae bairns, nae wife, will sorrow, when at last I'm laid awa',
   |    Nae oes will plant their daisies at my head;
   |  A' gane, but I will follow soon, an' weel content for a'
   |    There's nane but fremt to lay me in my bed.

   |  Earth to earth, an' dust to dust, an' the sowl gangs back to God:
   |    An' few there be wha think their day is lang;
   |  Yet here I'm weary waitin', till the Master gies the nod,
   |    To tak' the gait I've seen sae mony gang.
   |  I fear whiles He's forgotten on his eildit gard'ner here,
   |    But ae day He'll remember me, an' then
   |  My birn o' sins afore Him I'll spread on the Judgment fleer,
   |    Syne wait until the angel says "Come ben."

   |  There noo, the ill bird's flaffin' on the very riggin' stane,

   |  The order they will come in, ay, an' name them ilka ane,
   |    An' lang afore the funeral is here.
   |  The feathers will be noddin' as the hearse crawls past the Toll,
   |    As soon's they tap the knowe they'll be in sicht;
   |  The driver on the dickey knappin' sadly on his mull,
   |    Syne raxin' doon to pass it to the vricht.

   |  The factor in the carriage will be next, an' ridin' close
   |    The doctor, ruggin' hard upon his grey;
   |  The farmers syne, an' feuars speakin' laich aboot their loss,
   |    Yet thankfu' for the dram on sic a day.
   |  Ay, there at last they're comin', I maun haste an' lowse the tow

   |  Now Winter rides wi' angry skirl
   |  On sleety winds that rive an' whirl,
   |  An' gaberlunzie-like plays tirl
   |              At sneck an' lozen.
   |  The bairns can barely bide the dirl
   |              O' feet gane dozin.

   |  The ingle's heaped wi' bleezin' peats
   |  An' bits o' splutt'rin' firry reets
   |  Which shortly thow the ploughmen's beets;
   |              An' peels appear
   |  That trickle oot aneth their seats
   |              A' ower the fleer.

   |  The auld wife's eident wheel gaes birr,
   |  The thrifty lasses shank wi' virr;
   |  Till stents are finished nane will stir
   |              Lest Yule should come,
   |  When chiels fae wires the wark mith tirr
   |              To sweep the lum.

   |  The shepherd newly fae the hill
   |  Sits thinkin' on his wethers still;
   |  He kens this frost is sure to kill
   |              A' dwinin' sheep:
   |  His collie, tired, curls in its tail
   |              An' fa's asleep.

   |  Now Granny strips the bairns for bed:
   |  Ower soon the extra quarter fled
   |  For which sae sairly they had pled:
   |              But there, it chappit;
   |  An' sleepy "gweed words" soon are said,
   |              An' cauld backs happit.

   |  The milkers tak' their cogues at last,
   |  Draw moggins on, tie mutches fast,
   |  Syne hap their lantrens fae the blast
   |              Maun noo be met;
   |  An' soon the day's last jot is past,
   |              Milk sey'd an' set.

   |  Syne Sandy, gantin', raxes doon
   |  His fiddle fae the skelf aboon,
   |  Throws by the bag, an' souffs a tune,
   |              Screws up a string,
   |  Tries antics on the shift, but soon
   |              Starts some auld spring.

   |  Swith to the fleer ilk eager chiel
   |  Bangs wi' his lass to start the reel,
   |  Cries "Kissin' time"; the coy teds squeal,
   |              An' struggle vainly:
   |  The sappier smacks whiles love reveal,
   |              But practice mainly.

   |  An opening chord wi' lang upbow
   |  The fiddler strikes, syne gently now
   |  Glides into some Strathspey by Gow,
   |              Or Marshall't may be;
   |  The dancers lichtly needle thro';
   |              Rab sets to Leebie.

   |  Wi' crackin' thooms "Hooch! Hooch!" they reel.
   |  The winceys, spreadin' as they wheel,
   |  Gie stolen glints o' souple heel
   |              An' shapely queet.
   |  The guidman claps his hands, sae weel
   |              He's pleased to see't.

   |  The wrinkles leave the shepherd's broo,
   |  For see the sonsy mistress too
   |  Shows what the aulder fouks can do,
   |              An', licht's a bird,
   |  Some sober country dance trips thro'
   |              Wi' Jock the herd.

   |  Syne lads wha noo can dance nae mair
   |  To cauldrife chaumers laith repair;
   |  An' lasses, lauchin', speel the stair,
   |              Happy an' warm.
   |  For liftin' hearts an' killin' care
   |              Music's the charm!

   |  *An' deep the drift on muir an' fauld;*

   |  Wi' my Lord awa' at the Corbie's linn
   |    There was man nor dog at hame,

   |  Whaur, bonnet in hand, stood the gypsy there
   |    As raggit as she was braw.

   |  Neist mornin' at the skreek o' day
   |    The mist had newlins lifted;
   |  The sky, a whylock syne sae grey,
   |    To fleckit red had shifted:
   |  When suddenly our herts gaed thud
   |    To see a fremt chiel stalkin',
   |  Wi' timorous steps fae out the wud,
   |    As fleyed-like as a mawkin.
   |  Lod! sic a sicht, half hid in glaur,
   |    It made us a' feel wae, man;
   |  His hams were thin, his kyte was waur,
   |    It hung sae toom that day, man.
   |  His mattit beard was lang an' roch 's
   |    Gin it had ne'er been shorn;
   |  His kilt could barely fend his houghs
   |    Fae stobs, it was sae torn.
   |  A Greek was he, wha short afore
   |    At Troy was in the brulzie,
   |  An' tho' a halflin then, he bore
   |    A man's pairt in the tulzie.
   |  As soon's he spied our Trojan graith
   |    He nearhan' swarfed wi' fear;
   |  But maisterin' his dread o' skaith
   |    At last he ventured near.
   |  "I charge you by the stars," he cried,
   |    "And by the powers on high,
   |  To snatch me hence, nor lat me bide
   |    At Cyclops' hands to die.
   |  I'll no deny that I'm a Greek,
   |    Or that I was at Troy;
   |  Nor yet to hide the part, I'll seek,
   |    That I took in the ploy.
   |  Sae gin ye judge my fau't sae sair
   |    That grace ye daurna gie,
   |  Tear me to bits, fient haet I care,
   |    And sink me in the sea.
   |  I'll meet my death without a wird,
   |    If dealt by men like these,"
   |  He said: syne flang him on the yirds
   |    An' glammoched at our knees,
   |  Wi' kindly mint we stilled his fear,
   |    Enquired his name an' clan,
   |  An' what fell bluffert blew him here
   |    Wi' sic a hertless flan.
   |  To set him further at his ease
   |    Anchises gae him 's han',
   |  An' heartened by our kindliness
   |    The chiel at last began:
   |  "My name is Achaemenides,
   |    An' Ithaca my land;
   |  An' some ooks syne I crossed the seas
   |    Wi' poor Ulysses' band.
   |  Oh, why left ever I my hame?
   |    I'd troubles there enew;
   |  My comrades left me, to their shame,
   |    When fae Cyclops they flew.
   |  Cyclops himsel', wha can describe?
   |    The stars are ells below him;
   |  Gude send we ne'er may hae to bide
   |    Within a parish o' him.
   |  His dungeon large, a hauddin' fit
   |    For sic an awsome gleed;
   |  There at his fae's dregies he'll sit
   |    And spairge aboot their bleed.
   |  Wi' horrid scouk he frowns on a'
   |    An' heedless o' their skraichs,
   |  He sweels their monyfaulds awa'
   |    Wi' wauchts fae gory quaichs.
   |  I saw him, sirs, as sure's I live,
   |    Ance as he lay at easedom,
   |  Twa buirdly chiels tak' in his neive,
   |    Syne careless fae him heeze them.
   |  They fell wi' sic a dreadfu' thud,
   |    Whaur stanes lay roun' in cairns;
   |  The causey ran wi' thickened blood
   |    Like stoorum made wi' harns.
   |  I watched him tak' their limbs an' cram
   |    Them ower his weel-raxed thrapple;
   |  The life scarce left the quivering ham
   |    That shivered in his grapple.
   |  But never was Ulysses slack
   |    To pay where he was awin',
   |  An' starkly did he gie him 't back,
   |    An' bravely cleared the lawin'.
   |  For while the hoven monster snored,
   |    An' rifted in his dreams,
   |  We first the great God's help implored
   |    An' blessing on our schemes;
   |  The kavils cuist: a feerious thrang
   |    Syne gaithered roond aboot,
   |  An' wi' a sturdy pointed stang
   |    We bored his ae e'e oot."
